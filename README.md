# quora-insincere-questions
**These are just copies of the code from my public Kaggle kernels listed below.**

This repo does however feature a brief [.pdf report](https://github.com/tgregory98/Quora-insincere-questions-classification/blob/master/Report/Report.pdf) written in LaTeX (inside the 'Report' folder) which accounts how I approached this, and discusses the problem a little bit. This report gives you a general idea of what's going on if you don't want to read the code.

**NO DATA INCLUDED. See Kaggle competition page for data.**
