This repo does however feature a brief [.pdf report](https://github.com/tgregory98/Quora-insincere-questions-classification/blob/master/Report/Report.pdf) written in LaTeX (inside the 'Report' folder) which accounts how I approached this, and discusses the problem a little bit. This report gives you a general idea of what's going on if you don't want to read the code.
